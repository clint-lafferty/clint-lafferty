I am a career changer who through my years of professional experience has found a passion for IT; specifically cyber security.

## Objective

After working with technology as a chemist and an audio engineer, I began teaching myself how to write simple programs in python. This was the first step into my interest in Cyber Security. I am in process of studying for my CompTIA Sec+ cert and am using this repo as a way to document the different projects I am engaging in to hone applicable skills. My current objective is to join a Security Operations Center as a Tier 1 Soc Analyst
