I am a career changer who through my years of professional experience has found a passion for IT; specifically cyber security.

## Objective

With a background in technology through my work as a chemist and audio engineer, I began teaching myself Python, which sparked a deep interest in cybersecurity. I am currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification and using this repository to document hands-on projects that build practical, industry-relevant skills. My goal is to transition into a cybersecurity role, specifically as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst within a Security Operations Center.
